### LIRI-Node-App

The LIRI Node app enables the user to search for a musician's tour dates, find info about a song and search for movie information.
There are three main blocks of code, each dealing wih one functionality.

# concert-this
In the terminal, enter "node liri.js concert-this <artist>" to retrieve tour dates for the artist from the Bandsintown API. Results include the venue, city, state/region and country.

# spotify-this-song
In the terminal, type "node liri.js spotify-this-song <song title>", which will diplay the artist and a link to a 30-second preview of the track, courtesy of the Spotify API. If no song title is included, "The Sign" by Ace of Base will be returned,and no one wants that to happen.

# movie-this
Again in the terminal, type "node liri.js movie-this <movie title>" to query the OMDB API and return the film's year of release, IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes ratings, country of production, language, plot synopsis and main cast. If no title is entered, results for "Mr. Nobody" will be returned.

# do-what-it-says
"node liri.js do-what-it-says" will return Spotify information about "I Want It That Way" by the Backstreet Boys. Again, no one wants that, so avoid this at all costs.

4. Include screenshots, gifs or videos of the app functioning
